## What ASCA Is

**ASCA (ASC for CAP)** implements revenue allocation for the Coaching and App Plan bundles within the existing accounting batch system. It splits coaching charge revenue between Coaching and App products so that Freee journals correctly reflect the revenue split.

**JIRA:** [ASCA Board](https://bizmates.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/ASCA/summary) · [Backlog](https://bizmates.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/ASCA/boards/2792/backlog)

**Scope:** Bizmates-only (`mysql` connection). Builds the shared allocation framework that ASCI reuses.

## What ASCA Builds

1. **ASCM Prep:** Fix DataCorrectionLogic drift, extract BatchReportDeliveryService
2. **Shared Foundation:** DB migrations (`log_alloc_*` or `asc_alloc_*` — O-3 pending), models, enums, run lifecycle, allocation engine
3. **CAP-specific:** Detection for plans 1016–1027, reference prices (App ¥3,980, Coaching ¥19,800/¥39,600), AllocationDetail CSV
4. **Injection:** Allocation call in `CommonUtil::createDailyRateCalculation()` + `DataCorrectionLogic`
